Great progress so far! Here’s how you can move forward with Phase 1 based on your outlined roadmap:

Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
Define Project Scope & Features

Scope: Finalize what features the AR clothing try-on app will include. Here are some basics you might add to your document:
Real-time camera feed.
Pose detection with overlay.
Clothing selection from a menu.
Option to save or share the AR try-on image.
Features:
List the key components you'll need: camera feed integration, pose detection, 3D clothing models, AR rendering, and a user interface (UI) for interaction.
Set Up Development Environment

File Structure: Organize your project directory for easy access and modularity:
Create folders for:
components - for React components like CameraFeed, PoseOverlay, and ClothingSelector.
assets - for images, 3D models, and any static files.
utils - for helper functions (like those used for pose detection).
Environment Variables (if needed): If you plan to access an external API (e.g., for pose detection), create a .env file in your root directory to store your API keys. Add .env to your .gitignore to keep sensitive data secure.
Test Core Libraries

Install Core Libraries:
Install Three.js (for 3D rendering), TensorFlow.js (or MediaPipe for pose detection), and any additional packages you need for AR and UI:
bash
Copy code
npm install three @tensorflow-models/pose-detection @tensorflow/tfjs
Basic Tests:
Set up a basic camera feed test in a new component:
In the components folder, create CameraFeed.tsx.
Use the browser’s navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia() API to display the live camera feed.
Verify that TensorFlow.js or MediaPipe loads successfully and can process frames.
Suggested Next Steps:
Once you’ve set up and tested the basics, you can move into Phase 2 with Pose Detection Integration.

Let me know if you need help with specific code for camera feed or testing TensorFlow.js, and feel free to reach out when you’re ready for the next steps in Pose Detection Integration!
